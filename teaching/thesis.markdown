## Intruction

The _degree exam_ for the business and economics bachelor’s degree programs consists of the discussion and evaluation of a final paper written in english on a subject related to a course the student has succesfully passed.

## Burocratic Instruction

General burocratic instructions on the thesis can be found [here](http://www.luiss.edu/students/student-office/bachelors-degree-programs/degree-exams).

## Benefit of writing a thesis

The rewards of writing a thesis are broad. Students become experts on A subject; they get a hands on experience in designing research to understand complex problems. They develop skills in critical analysis, argumentation, inductive and deductive reasoning; learn how to contextualize their ideas within scholarly and public debates; become more conscientious writers; and practice collaboration through peer review and feedback — all of which are important to academic and non-academic careers. 

Last, but not least, the process of writing a thesis allows a student to get to know, and work closely with, a faculty member.
