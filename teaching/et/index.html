<h2>Course description</h2>

<p>Econometric Theory is a year-long course. The course can be thought as composed of two parts.</p>

<p>The <strong>first part</strong> focuses on the specification and estimation of the linear
regression model. The course departs from the standard Gauss-Markov assumptions
to include heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, and errors in
variables. Advanced topics include generalized least squares, instrumental
variables, generalized method of moments, and limited dependent variable models.</p>

<p>The <strong>second part</strong> focuses on the theory and the applications of time series
methods in econometrics, including spectral analysis, estimation with
stationary and non-stationary processes, VARs, factor models, unit roots,
cointegration, estimation of DSGE models, Bayesian methods.</p>

<p>For both partss there will be a number of problem sets using real data sets and
applying methods similar to those studied in class. They will all require
analysis of data sets on computers. The recommended software package is Matlab.</p>

<h2>Course objectives</h2>

<p>The course main objective is to provide students with a solid grasp of the
probabilistic and statistical underpinnings of the most common econometric
techniques.  The topics studied will be of practical use to any student who plans on
confronting data in their thesis or wishes to read and precisely understand the
econometrics typically used in empirical research published in academic journals.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>

<p>Lectures of the first part of the course will be mostly based on the following two graduate textbooks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wooldridge, Jeffrey M. Econometric analysis of cross section and panel data. MIT press, 2010.</li>
<li>Cameron, A. Colin, and Pravin K. Trivedi. Microeconometrics: methods and applications. Cambridge university press, 2005.</li>
</ul>


<p>A third textbook is Bruce E. Hansen&#8217;s &#8220;Econometrics&#8221; which can be freely downloaded <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Lectures of the second part will be based on the following textbooks:</p>

<ul>
<li>J.D. Hamilton. Time Series Analysis. Princeton University Press, 1994</li>
<li>P.J. Brockwell and R.A. Davis. Time Series: Theory and Methods. Springer series in statistics. Springer, 1986</li>
<li>A. Zellner. An introduction to Bayesian inference in econometrics. Wiley series in probability and mathematical statistics: Applied probability and statistics. J. Wiley, 1971</li>
</ul>

<h2>Matlab resources</h2>

<p>There are many resources on-line that you can use to get acquainted with this powerful computer language. I suggest you to check the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mathworks.it/academia/student_center/tutorials/launchpad.html">MATLAB Tutorials</a>, from MathWorks the maker of Matlab;</li>
<li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/software/matlab/www/home.html">Matlab at MIT</a>; full of useful resources</li>
</ul>


<p>Matlab is proprietary software. Alternatively you can use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a>, an open source programming language mostly compatible with Matlab.</p>
